# MIDI/Analog to DMX on Arduino
Arduino code for using MIDI data and Analog signals to control a DMX dimmer pack.

This uses the MIDI and SimpleDMX Arudino libraries. I put this together a couple of years ago before I had learned more coding best practices, so pardon the poor architecture! I hope to update this soon.
